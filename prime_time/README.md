Basic Garmin app showing the prime-time, made for Instinct 2S but should work on practically any device. (Though the layout may differ, and other devices may also have colour screens enabling a different setup.)

Layout: 
It shows the seconds-hand in high power mode, and the minutes-hand in low power mode. This can easily be switched to other hands in the code. The hours are shown in the top right as a number with a simple arc around it.

To side-load it onto your device see https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/your-first-app/ (Summary: connect your watch to your laptop via USB, and put the pre-built *prg* file in this folder into its *GARMIN/APPS* directory.)

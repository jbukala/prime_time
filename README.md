Small Python CLI script to make a polar plot of the current time in HH:MM:SS, but making a prime decomposition of each number. Meant as a POC for the concept of a watch face.

![Example plot of the time. Each number is represented by its prime decomposition and plotted on a polar plot, where *theta* shows the prime factor and *r* counts amount of factors of this prime in the number](./prime_time.png)

Pull requests for implementations on an actual smartwatch (e.g. Garmin) are very welcome.
